# TelosEVM ExEx Example

Note that the main.rs is a copy of the telos-reth [main.rs](https://github.com/telosnetwork/telos-reth/blob/telos-main/crates/telos/bin/src/main.rs) file, with the addition of `.install_exex("Example", exex::exex_init)` to the builder.  As TelosEVM gets updated, this main.rs file may need to also be updated with those changes.
